# What is Market Making?

There's many analogies out there attempting to simplify this somewhat complex topic, into an understable and simple concept.

###  *"Dad, what's this Market Making thing you do all day?"*
Imagine you are back to being 6 years old, with 2 sisters and a brother. At home, it's common for Dad to ask you to bring him a glass of water to the shed as he is often occupied with his games. Now, since he has to convince you to come to him, go fill a glass of water and bring it back to him, he gives you an extra 30 minutes of iPad time per day as an incentive for making his life a little easier. 

Remember the other siblings in the house? It's all fair game, and if they respond to him before you do, you get nothing! You arrive to his office and find he already has a glass of water, and you've just wasted your time going up the stairs for no reward. 

Whilst all this is happening, don't forget Mum is also in the house! Similarly to Dad, she sometimes asks you to get her book from the living room and bring it back to her. Though, she's more strict and only hands out an extra 15 minutes of extra iPad time. 

Knowing all this, where do you be all day? Clearly it's more benefitial to get to Dad first as he gives out an extra 30 minutes, but you spend most of your time in the house so getting to Mum is quicker, and doesn't waste as much time if one of your siblings got to her first.

So in the end, you decide to hide a jug of water near the backdoor of the house, and do your homework near the rear of the house. You now stand an equal chance of getting both to Mum and Dad incase they need you, but significantly increasing your chances whenever dad calls you. 

Congrats, you've just become a Market Maker! Lets translate all this back to trading terminology now...

Your dad is called CZ, and your mum is called Arthur Hayes (plausable, it's 2024). Instead of water and a book, they want BTC & ETH respectively. You make money by providing them the service of getting them the coins they want on demand, and ideally selling it to them higher than what you bought it for. Otherwise, why would you waste your time sitting and "waiting outside their door" all day if it wasnt for a reward? 

They don't care where you bought it from, could be Bybit, Coinbase, OKX or wherever you want really, but in the small universe of exchanges, there won't be much to pick from. Knowing this, you tell each market the price you're willing to accept at any given time by placing a limit order, knowing what your costs are for getting the coin from A to B, whilst still making a profit.

But there are many others offering the same service as you, competing for the same reward (just as your siblings did!). It leaves you with two choices, join them at the same price and stay closer to the exchange (aiming to be faster than them), or study what time he asks for water and only get close to the shed when he's most likely to ask, opting to sit inside in the AC otherwise (smarter than them). To be a successful Market Maker, you're likely going to have to play your hand in both of these! It's very difficult to get away with just focusing on either choice solely.

The reality of the situation is, your Dad knows all the kids want extra iPad time, and as there are many in close proximity to him. He can still convince one of them with only offering 10 minutes of extra time, as opposed to the 30 minutes he would have to offer to convince you at an odd time of the day. It's natural for competition to drive each others profit margins lower and lower, each chasing a larger piece of the pie for themselves. Knowing your weaknesses is good, but knowing your competition's weakness is better. It's highly unlikely your siblings will bother answering your Dad at 9AM, so wake up early and enjoy the larger rewards!

There are more concepts not covered here such as "Adverse Selection", and how much the market changes when there's suddenly more demand (not just more supply). For now though, this should cover the fundamentals enough to hopefully convince you to have a go at it :)
